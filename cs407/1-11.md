# 1.11 AES, Blowfish and modes of opertaion 

A new encryption standard was needed, the challenge was open to all companies. The old standard (DES) eventually became insecure 

The new options were narrowed down to 5 choices including Rijndael and Twofish

in 2001, announced Rijndael as the winner

## AES 
AES stands for the Advanced Encryption Standard and is the encryption which is used in SSL (secure socket layer) 

### standard structure

plaintext = 128 bits long 

1. split the plaintext into a 4x4 array of bytes like below: 
| c1 | c2 | c3 | c4  |
|----|----|----|-----|
|  1 |  5 |  9 |  13 |
|  2 |  6 | 10 |  14 |
|  3 |  7 | 11 |  15 |
|  4 |  8 | 12 |  16 |

2. generate a key from the main key (key[0])

3. XOR plaintext and key[0]

4.
