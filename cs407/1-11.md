# 1.11 AES, Blowfish and modes of opertaion 

A new encryption standard was needed, the challenge was open to all companies. The old standard (DES) eventually became insecure 

The new options were narrowed down to 5 choices including Rijndael and Twofish

in 2001, announced Rijndael as the winner

## AES 
AES stands for the Advanced Encryption Standard and is the encryption which is used in SSL (secure socket layer) 

### standard structure

plaintext = 128 bits long 

1. split the plaintext into a 4x4 array of bytes like below: 


|----|----|----|-----|
|  1 |  5 |  9 |  13 |
|  2 |  6 | 10 |  14 |
|  3 |  7 | 11 |  15 |
|  4 |  8 | 12 |  16 |


2. generate a key from the main key (key[0])

3. XOR plaintext and key[0]

4. begin the rounds

5. types of operations
**Sub bytes**: substitution operations which take the byte in a given position and substitute it
with a different value.
**Shift Rows**: shifts bytes along within a row in a cycllical nature 
**Mix Columns**: Take a whole column and shift that around to a different position 
**Add round key**: use our key schedual to derive multiple keys from the main key and get the key for the current round ex. key[round]

**Note** **The Mixed column step isnt completed in the final round!**  
This uses the feistel cipher 

## Blowfish 
the left half of the plaintext block is XOR with the result of a function applied to the right half using the round key 
the output of that function is used for the right side (they are switched) 

## Cipher block chaining 

### ECB electronic code book 
each block is encrypted seperatly 

### CBC cipher block chaining 
- each block is XOR'd with the previous block before encryption 
- requires initialisation vector and padding
