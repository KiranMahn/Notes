# 3.4 Access control overview 

## Identification
Claim an identity 

## Authentication
Try to confirm an identity 

## Authorisation 
Verifying what permissions a user has to access files/data

## Ways to Authenticate a user 
- knowledge (something you know) ex. text based password 
- Biometrics (something you are) ex. fingerprints, iris, retina, voice recognition 
- Tokens (something you have) ex. access cards 

## MFA
**multi factor authentication** 
a combination of two seperate factor categories (bio + passwrod) or (token + bio) etc. 

Drawback - less usable
