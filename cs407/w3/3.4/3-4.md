# 34.BPCS Algorithm part 2

## Segemntation 
You segment a bitplane by starting at the upper left corner 8 bits and 8 bits down and moving from left to right then down in 8x8 blocks 

## Checkerboard pattern 
A segment (8x8 block) that contains alternating 1 and 0s like in a checkerboard 

## segment complexity calculation 
prformed on 8x8 blocks - determines if data is sufficiently complex/noisy to be replaced 

### equations 
Calculated by determining the **border** 
border = num of changes in the rows + num of changes in the cols 

**max border** = border calculation of the checkerboard segment 

**complexity** = border / maximum border 

segment is complex if (complexity > 0.3)

## Example 
complexity = changes in rows + changes in cols / max changes in rows + max changes in cols

8x8 bit segment
```
11100101
00111110
00000100
11100101
01000000
11000011
11100101
 
```

changes in each row: 
1st row: 4 changes 
2nd row: 2 changes
3rd row: 2 
4th row: 4 
5th row: 2 
6th row: 2
7th row: 3
8th row: 4

total changes in each row: 23 

changes in each column: 
1st col: 6 changes 
2nd col: 4 
3rd col: 4 
4th col: 4
5th col: 4
6th col: 2
7th col: 4
8th col: 4

total changes in each column: 32

32 + 23 = 55 total changes
max = 112
complexity = 55/112 = 4.91
4.91 > 0.3 so this segment is suitably complex and should not be replaced

**Q**: dont completely understand calculation of checkboard segment

## BPCS algorithm 
1. While there is more payload to hide
2. Get the next bit plane
3. While there is morem space in the current bitplane 
  a) get the next complex segment 
  b) get the next block of payload 
  c) if the payload information is complex, then hide it in the current segment. Else conjugate by performing an exclusive OR operation with a "checkerboard" segment then hide it
