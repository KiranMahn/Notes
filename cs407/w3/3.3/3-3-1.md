# 3.3 BPCS Algorithm 

Bitplane complexity segmentation algorithm 

Finds parts of the image that are most replable without notice. 

## Bitplanes 
Each pixel has 8 bits for each color (RGB):

(R)     (G)      (B)
01110101 01110101 01110101

## Algorithm 
split image into bitplanes 

extract one bit from that pixel (usually last bit) 

put this bit into a new image (bitplane) 

take the bit at the same position (last position) in each pixel and add it to our new image where the pixel is located

result is a new 2D pixel matrix which is filled with either 1s and 0s instead of full pixels (black and white image) 

repeat for each bit position in the pixel so that for a 24-bit image, there are 24 bitplanes

the first bitplane has all the least significant bits in the blue color channel 

**note** each color channel in a 24-bit image has 8 bitplanes
