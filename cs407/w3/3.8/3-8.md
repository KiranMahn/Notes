# 3.8 Biometrics Overview 

## Definition
A sufficiently distinctive trait that can be measured, quantified, and stored so that it can be used to autuhenticate a user

ex. facial identification, fingerprint, how you type (behavioral biometrics) 

## Enrollment vs operation 

Enrollment is a template (how the trait is represented in the computer) like if a fingerprint is broken down into loops and swirls 

## Identification vs verification
Identification - using biometrics to find a user in a db
Verification - user matches with a stored template of biometric recognition 

## biometric Accuracy 
True positive rate - True accept rate (the % of users correctly authenticated
True regect rate - % accuractly rejected
False accept rate - % false accepted 
False reject rate - % false rejected

## ROC curve 
receiver operating characteristic curve 

maps our true accept rate vs false accept rate 

**True accept rate** = True positives / (true positives + false negatives) 
% of accurate positives 

**False accept rate** = False positives / (false positives + true negatives)
