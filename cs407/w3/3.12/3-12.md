# 3.12 Authorisation 

Authorisation - you have access to system, but are you permitted to complete this particular task 

## Access control model (Lampson) 

Subject --> Access Request --> Regerence Monitor --> Object 

**Reference Monitor**: Part of system that checks if whether you do have the correct authorization levels for that particular object or data 

## Access modes: 
Observe 
Alter 

(read vs write vs execute) 

## Linux 

Owner: user who created object 
Group: defined group of users 
World: anyone who tries to access it

`rwx` --> read, write, and execute 
`rw-` --> read, write
`r--` --> read

## Least privilage principle
give everyone as little access as possible to do their job 

### Vertical privilege escalation 
Attacker tries to move onto an account w/ more access than they have. If someone works w/ a uni, trying to gain access to an HR account which has salary data which is more access than they have

### Horizontal escalation attack 
Some access funtionality, but different data. ex. if you have an account for a bank, trying to get accescs to someone else's account. Same level of functions
