# 3.13 Oauth - Web authorisation protocol 

# OAuth: Summary

**OAuth (Open Authorization)** is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for users to grant websites or applications limited access to their resources without exposing their credentials. It is primarily used to enable secure authorization for web, mobile, and desktop applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Authorization vs. Authentication**: OAuth is an authorization protocol, not an authentication protocol. It allows users to grant access to resources without sharing passwords.
- **Tokens**: OAuth uses tokens as credentials to access resources on behalf of a user. These tokens are typically time-limited and can be scoped to grant specific permissions.
- **Roles**:
  - **Resource Owner**: The user who owns the data or resource.
  - **Client**: The application requesting access to the resource.
  - **Authorization Server**: The server that issues access tokens after successfully authenticating and authorizing the user.
  - **Resource Server**: The server hosting the resource that the client wants to access.

## OAuth Flow

1. **User Authentication**: The client requests authorization from the user to access their resources.
2. **Authorization Grant**: The user approves or denies the request, and if approved, an authorization code is issued.
3. **Token Request**: The client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by contacting the authorization server.
4. **Access Resource**: The client uses the access token to request the protected resource from the resource server.

## OAuth Grant Types

- **Authorization Code Grant**: Suitable for web and mobile apps. The client receives an authorization code that it exchanges for an access token.
- **Implicit Grant**: Used for public clients (e.g., single-page apps) where the access token is issued directly. Considered less secure.
- **Password Grant**: Allows clients to obtain tokens by directly using the resource owner's credentials. Generally discouraged for security reasons.
- **Client Credentials Grant**: Suitable for machine-to-machine communication where no user is involved.

## Use Cases

- **Third-Party Authentication**: OAuth allows users to sign in to websites or apps using accounts from other platforms (e.g., "Log in with Google").
- **APIs and Services**: OAuth is used to authorize access to APIs without exposing user credentials.

## Security Considerations

- Use **HTTPS** to protect token exchanges and authorization flows.
- **Token Scoping**: Limit permissions granted by tokens to reduce potential damage in case of misuse.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Issue short-lived access tokens and use refresh tokens to maintain long-term access.

## Conclusion

OAuth provides a secure, standardized way for users to grant limited access to their resources without sharing sensitive credentials. It is widely adopted across the web to enable secure integrations between different applications and services.
