# 3.2 LSB algorithm 

## LSB
type of steganography that uses digital images or other cover objects to hide data 

The least significant bit within a given byte is the right most bit which causes the most mininmal change to the naked eye 

Go through the data bit by bit, if the lsb matches the next bit we leave it as it, else we flip it

## Decoding 
You will need to know 
 - where does the message stop
 - what is the extension of the file that you're hiding
 - a way to ensure consistency

## Bit manipulation in Java
``` Java 
int lsb = byt & 0x1; //get the lsb by permorning bitwise w/ 0x1

byt &= ~ 0x1; //change lsb to a 0 by bitwise and with the complement of 0x1

byt |= 0x1; // performs bitwise OR with 0x1 to change LSB to a 1

byt << shiftVal; // shifts to the left by int shiftVal 

byt >> shiftVal; // shifts to the right by shiftVal

^ //performs exclusive OR

```

## Randomness 
This algorithm only has a set number of ways to be implemented so use a form of random number generator and seed to determine the next position to hide some information in
