## Password Security Summary

### Password Generation
- Strong password generation is challenging; simple passwords are easy to recall but vulnerable, while random ones are secure but hard to remember.
- Password strength is often measured using entropy, a concept derived from information theory. Higher entropy indicates more randomness and greater security.
- Human-generated passwords are often predictable, reducing their effective entropy.
- Recommendations now favor using three random words for memorable and secure passwords over complex but hard-to-remember combinations.

### Storing Passwords
- Passwords should never be stored in plaintext; instead, they are hashed using cryptographic hashing functions (e.g., bcrypt).
- Adding a unique salt (a pseudo-random string) to each password before hashing ensures that even identical passwords produce different hashes.
- Salts prevent attacks like pre-computed hash table attacks by making each password hash unique.

### Authentication Process
- During authentication, the provided password is salted and hashed, and the resulting hash is compared with the stored hash.
- Limiting the number of login attempts (e.g., three strikes rule) helps prevent brute force attacks.

### Attacking Passwords
- **Brute Force**: Attempts all possible passwords; time-consuming but effective without additional protections.
- **Password Guessing**: Exploits knowledge about the user to guess passwords.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses lists of common passwords, pop culture references, and dictionary words; more efficient than brute force.
- **Pre-computed Hash Tables**: Attackers can use lookup tables to match hashed passwords with known values; salts mitigate this threat.

### One-Time Passwords (OTPs)
- OTPs are temporary passwords used for single sessions, providing additional security (commonly used in banking).

### Security Guidance
- Password management practices are evolving to emphasize usability and security.
- Using a mix of hash functions, salts, and secure password generation can mitigate risks.
- Refer to recommendations like those from the National Cyber Security Centre for best practices.
