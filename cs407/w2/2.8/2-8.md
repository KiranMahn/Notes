# 2.8 End to End Encryption 

There are two approaches to secure communication across a network: 

1. Alice has a key, Bob has a key, and the server has a key for Alice and Bob

2. End to end encryption (E2EE): The server **Does Not** hold the decryption key for either Alice or Bob and uses a symmetric key sharing algorithm like Diffie Hellman using public key cryptography 

Whatsapp and Signal use E2EE
