#2.6 Digital Signatures 

## Purpose of a digital signature 
Assurance of integrity of message and origin authentication 

## High level 
Private key = S (signing)
Public key = V (verification)

message from us = M 

apply our private key = (M)s, M

send to recipient 

recipient applies public key to message

v((M)s)

compares to message M, is values are the same then message has not been altered or tampered with

Difficult to do this with small messages like the number 1 so a hash function is used to encrypt the message into any desired length (128bit, 256bit) 

## Mutual authentication 

Mutual authentication is when the message is signed on both sides (Alice and Bob) and has been Authenticated on both sides
