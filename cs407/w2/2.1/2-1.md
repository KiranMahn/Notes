# 2.1 Diffie Hellman Key Exchanged 

## How do both parties share a key in a secure mannor? 

p = large prime
g = a number 

p and g are mathmatically related (necessary) 

a = alice's private key (num)

b = Bob's private key (num) 

A = g^a mod p

B = g^b mod P

K = shared key

key is shared

K = B^a mod P --> g^(b*a) mod P  

K = A^b mod P --> g^(a*b) mod P
