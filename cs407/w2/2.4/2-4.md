# 2.4 RSA Lab 

Commands: 

1. Generate your RSA private key using the following command:

`openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out yourkeys.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048`

This command should create the file containing the generated private key in /home/rjb21151

2. extract just the public key

`openssl pkey -in yourkeys.pem -out yourpubkey.pem -pubout`

3. Now, swap your public key with a friend. We’ll call them Bob for simplicity. Encrypt a file with Bob’s public key as follows:

`openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -pubin -inkey bobpubkey.pem -in /Users/kiranmahn/notes/cs407/w2/2.4 -out cipher.txt`

4. Now swap the resulting encrypted file with Bob, and decrypt it using your private key as follows:

`openssl pkeyutl -decrypt -inkey yourkeys.pem -in cipher.txt -out decrypted.txt`
