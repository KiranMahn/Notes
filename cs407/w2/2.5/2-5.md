# 2.5 Cryptographic randomness and one time pads 

## Randomness 

**PRNG** (Puesdo random number generators) are alforithms that produce a series of nums which seem random. You start with a truly random seed value and then generate subsequent vals

PRNG vs **CSPRNG**: CSPRNG have additional requirements than PRNG but are still indestinguishable from true randomness and are suitable to prevent attacks but since they are deterministic they are also good for situations where you need to replicate the vals generated like for testing 

## One Time Pad
One time pad is when a truly random key stream is used to encrypt the message

### Example

```
Key: lxtyo

Plaintext: hello 

Ciphertext: tcfld (e.g. l(=12) + h(=8) --> t(=20) 
```

### Requirements

A one time pad must meet the following reqs:
 - it is truly random 
 - only two copies should exist (for encryption and one for decryption) 
 - it is one use only (destroyed after used) 
 - it is at least as long as the plaintext 

> **Fun Fact**: The first puedo random number generator (PRNG) was developed in **1949** by John Von Neumann and was called the **middle square method**

### Middle Square Method

1. create seed from rand num (s)

2. square the seed s^2

3. extract the middle digits as your new seed 

4. repeat 

#### Example

1. Seed = 3792
   squared = 3792^2 = 14,374,464
   middle digits = 3744
   new seed = 3744

2. Seed = 3744 
   squared = 3744^2 = 14,013,536
   middle digits = 0135 (leading zero stays)
   new seed = 0135

3. Seed = 0135
   squared = 0135^2 = 18,225
   middle digits = 1822
   new seed = 1822

a **period** is when these nubmers begin to repeat in the PRNG
