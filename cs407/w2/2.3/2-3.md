# 2.3 RSA

## Generating keys using RSA

1. identify two large and distrinct primes (p and q) 

2. identify the product (n)

> n = p * q

**Note** p and q must be sufficiently large so that they are not too easy to figure out

3. Calculate Euler's function 
 
> Eulers function is the number of positive ints up to the value of an int (n) which are **coprime** with (n) 

>  **Coprime** means the largest common divisor is 1 ex. 8 and 15 are corpime because the largest common divisor they share is 1. divisors of 8 = {1,2,4,8} divisors of 15={1,3,5,15}

Euler's function = p(n) 
p(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1)

4. find an int (e)

e < p(n) 

5. find d

d = e^(-1) mod (p(n))

d is now the **private key** 

### Toy Example (using small numbers to understand implementation, not suitable for security) 

1. p = 5, q = 11 

2. n = 5 * 11 = 55 

3. p(n) = (5-1 = 4) * (11-1 = 10) = 40

4. e < 40 && e is a coprime of 40; e can be 7

5. d = 7^(-1) mod 40 
   7d = 1 mod 40 
   7(23) = 1 mod 40 **Note** 23 here was found through randomly trying different values 

## Application to encryption and decryption 

public key = e, n
private key = d, n

1. to encrypt split message into blocks: p1, p2, ...

2. (p1)^e mod n = C1 

c1 = cipher block

3. p1 = (C1)^d mod n 

p1 = plaintext 

### Takeaways: 

 - d for decryption 
 - e for encryption 
 - e is private key 
 - d is public key

### Application to toy example

e = 7, d = 23
n = 55
B = 2

1. 2^7 mod 55 
   = 128 mod 55
C1 = 18

2. 18 ^ 23 mod 55 = 2

decryption worked!!!
