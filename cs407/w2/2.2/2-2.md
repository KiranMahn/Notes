# 2.2 Introducing Public Key Cryptography 

Solutions to public key exchange: 
 - diffie-hellman 
 - key cryptography (asymmetric cryptography) 

## Diffie hellman 
private key kept by entity 
public key which is shared 

the key pair is **mathmatically** linked 
the private key can only be decrypted by its matching public key 

if Alice wants to communicate with Bob she must use his public key, so that he can use his private key to decrypt it
