# 1.12 Making block ciphers usable & message authentication codes

good practice: don't use a block or stream cipher as is, instead insure the initialisation vector and ciphertext can't be modified without resulting in a warning/error

## MAC Message Authentication Code
use of a cryptographic hash function with a secret key 
**purpose**: assurance that the message has not been altered 

the MAC function takes a secret key and makes an authentification tag which can only be calculated by those who know the secret key 

This means that the message cann't be changed unless the secret key is known so this prevents tampering with data

MAC is a private hash function that is deterministic as the same hash function, message, and key will always generate the same auth tag 

**FLAW**: With some hash functions there are potential attacks which can append data and provide an updated hash value. This type of attack can be used against SHA-2, and are called length extension attacks 

## HMAC hash-based message authentication code 
one of the most commonly used MACs
two sub keys are derived from the secret key (k1, k2) 
message = message + k1
h1 = hashed(message) 
authentification tag = hashed(h1 + k2)

authentication tags need to be sufficiently long to be secure (generally 128 bits or longer, with HMACs the hash length defines the authentication tag length) and verification of authentication tags can be prone to errors
