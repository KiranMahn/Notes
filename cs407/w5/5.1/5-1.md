# 5.1 Networks intro

## What is a computer network 
collection of computers (nodes) like pcs mobiles tablests etc. that can **communicate with each other** 
ex. send and recieve data using **protocols** 
its a combo of software and hardware 

## Most common network 
the internet - uses IP (internet protocol) 

## Simple network forms 
two devices connected to each other wired or wirelessly 

## Addressing 
network addreessing lets us know which computer should receive the data 
**IP address** - internet protocol address 

## Types of networks 
**WAN** wide area network - spans a large area ex. the internet
**LAN** local area network - spans a smaller area (geographically) ex. home network 

## Data communication over networks 
data is transmitted in packets over the network as chunks of data
**Protocol** is agreed set of rules for tramitting info between computers ex. TCP/IP protocol is used for internet communication 
## **Ports** provide a virtual start and end point for network communication.
 - start and end point 
 - managed by operating system 
 - standardised - each port has an assigned number that does not change
 - specific port numbers and ranges are assigned differnt protocols to aid in distinguishing different types of traffic to process it more easily 
 - ex. HTTP using port 80 like 8080 or 8081

## How computers send data - Hardware 
**Network inferface Card (NIC)** - harware circuit which allows connection to a networks and turns data into an electrical signal 
**Media Access Control address (MAC)** - a hard wired ID specific to the network interface of the machine 
**Hub** - connects multiple machines to a network by broadcasting packets to all computers 
**Switch** - sends packets to intended desitnation 
**routers** - provide connection to the internet and manage data transmit and receive data from the internet

## The internet - key components 
 - HTTP - hyper text transfer protocol 
 - HTML - hyper text markup language 
 - IP address - unique id for all devices connected to the internet 
 - URL - uniform resource locator - readable ip address 
 - DNS - domain name server translates urls into ip addresses 
 - ARP - address resolution protocol translates IP addresses to MAC addresses
