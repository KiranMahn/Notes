# 1.3 Cryptographic Hash Functions 

[Full article](https://classes.myplace.strath.ac.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=1557191)

## What is a cryptographic hash? 
A cryptographic hash function takes data and produces a string that represents the data using both characters and numbers called a **hash value** or **digest** 

## Common hash function standards are SHA-256 and MD5 (MD5 is **insecure** and should not be used) 

## Properties of hash functions
1. an input always gives the same output (deterministic) 

## properties of cryptographic hash functions
1. deterministic
2. pre-image resistant: you can't know the input from only the hash value, you need the map too
3. second pre-image resistant: with one specific input, it is difficult and **computationally infeasible** to find another input with the same hash
4. collision resistant: it should be difficult to find two inputs with the same hash 

> **Q:** What is the difference between second pre-image resistance and collision resistance? 

## Limits
1. small or predicatable messages can be easily figured out even when hashed
2. you have to trust the hash function source and its security
